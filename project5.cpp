    The program should be able to read in from a file of x baby names,
    space sorted for example: "1 Waldo Alice" where it has first, the rank
    of the name, then the male and then the female for that rank. The program
    should then be able to take user input for a name, then print out the ranking
    for both the male and female for that name
